# data-science-projects

Here are my first 3 small projects on data science using `R` and `Python`. In each folder you can find csv file which contains raw data, my coding file and the presentation I've created to highlight key findings.

Please if you could give me some advice/ feedback I would be very grateful :)

Please report issues [here](https://github.com/jackie-pham31/data-science-projects/issues). Many thanks!
