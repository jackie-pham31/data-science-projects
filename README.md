# data-analysis-projects

Here are my first 4 small projects on data analysis using `R` and `Python`. In each folder you will find csv file which contains raw data, my coding file and the presentation I've created to highlight key findings.

All these projects are inspired/ suggested by Codecademy where I've been participating in several online courses on Data analysis and Programming.

It would be great if you could read them through and give me some advice/ feedback on how to improve the codes :)

Please report issues [here](https://github.com/jackie-pham31/data-science-projects/issues). 

Many thanks,

Jackie
