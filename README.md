# data-science-projects

Here are my first 3 small projects on data science using `R` and `Python`. In each folder you can find csv file which contains raw data, my coding file and the presentation I've created to highlight key findings.

Again,I have no background or previous experience so please comment nicely and if you can give me some advices I would be very grateful :)

Please report issues [here](https://github.com/jackie-pham31/data-science-projects/issues). Many thanks!

Jackie
